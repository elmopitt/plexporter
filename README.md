# plexporter
Exports media from locally-accessible Plex servers.

## Overview

Plex is amazing, but it's not streamlined for performing local-ish operations on media files (e.g., copying files to a USB stick, applying metadata changes to files, etc). Plexporter is a supplemental application for performing such operations.

## Restrictions

No, Plexporter will not help you download media from shared Plex libraries. It will not allow you to copy any files or make any changes beyond those that you could already make yourself. It simply offers the convenience of using an organized Plex library for navigating content.
