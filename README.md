# plexporter
Exports media from locally-accessible Plex servers.

Plex is amazing, but it's not streamlined for performing local-ish operations on media files (e.g., copying files to a USB stick, applying metadata changes to files, etc). Plexporter is a supplemental application for performing such operations.
